# Project Description 
Our project aims to connect pet owners around Orange County for various interests. Whether pet owners want to meet up for dog walks, potty training lessons, general veterinary information, or even find soulmates for their pets, our application serves the general public with a variety of options for their beloved animals.

In this application users are able to create an account with their information & their petâ€™s information. Users can add, update, and delete pets on their profile. A forum will be readily available for every user to view & interact with.
In the application users can post onto the forum, comment on posts, and edit/delete their own posts.
